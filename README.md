This repository demonstrates a common error in Kotlin: using the `first()` function on an empty list. The `first()` function throws a `NoSuchElementException` if the list is empty. The solution shows how to use the `firstOrNull()` function to safely handle this case.  This error frequently occurs when dealing with lists or collections where the emptiness is a valid possibility and should be handled gracefully.
